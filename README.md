# city_gen
this program makes a city from scratch and creates a map of it. it can save the cities which are generated but not images of them. Ideally it would be able to do both but
i am not sure how to use libpng yet. I seriously doubt you will be able to use this because i am using a custom utilities library to do random numbers and probably other stuff too but its like 2 am and i don't remember. the random number generator uses a lfsr that is like 3 lines and it shouldn't be that bad. I'll work on getting documetation up for this thing once i stop being so tired.
